# MultiMICO

Multi-Modality and Contextualisation

Computing devices are everywhere and we live increasingly in a mutli-device ecology. This project explores concepts, experiences and tools to 
shape this device ecology to our needs for connecting machine learning and real-world environments.

This project collects the theoretical and conceptual foundations for multi-modality and contextualisation.
