# MultiMICO

Multi-Modality and Contextualisation

Computing devices are everywhere and we live increasingly in a mutli-device ecology. This project explores concepts, experiences and tools to 
shape this device ecology to our needs for connecting machine learning and real-world environments.

This project collects the theoretical and conceptual foundations for multi-modality and contextualisation. 

## Ongoing work

Completed Tasks become available in the main-branch of the repository. 

**Ongoing and incomplete Tasks** are collected and discussed in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/dxiai/multimico/issues). Most of the discussion will be in German.
